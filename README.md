# PM2.5 (*Mac-only for now*)

  > Because I’m sick of reading 3-hour moving averages.

## Why PM2.5?

  Because out of the various [measurements that NEA takes](http://www.haze.gov.sg/haze-updates/pollutant-concentrations/type/PM25-1Hr), the PM2.5 is a hourly 1-hour average, meaning it’s more responsive as a measure overall, as opposed to the hourly 3-hour moving average.

## Where does the Data Come From?

  Well, we are scraping it from here: http://www.haze.gov.sg/haze-updates/pollutant-concentrations/type/PM25-1Hr
